# Roblox Connections Renamer

A lightweight browser extension that renames all instances of "Connections" on Roblox back to "Friends".

## ‚ú® What It Does

This extension automatically replaces every instance of the term "Connections" with "Friends" across the Roblox website interface, including buttons and page titles, to restore the classic terminology that users are more familiar with. It also updates related terms like "Connection", "Connect", and "Remove Connection" to their "Friend" counterparts.
